## Power Supply

- **Recommended:** 3.3V, peak current >200mA
- **Supply Pins:** Pin 3 (3V3), multiple GND pins
- **Notes:** Use LDO for best RF performance; add ESD protection at power input.

---

## UART (for Firmware Update/Console)

- **RX:** P10 (Pin 30)
- **TX:** P9 (Pin 31)
- **Default Baud Rate:** 115200 bps
- **Notes:** UART is used for programming, debugging, and optional CLI.

## Antenna & RF

- On-board PCB antenna; keep module edge clear of ground planes and metal for best performance.
- See datasheet for layout and keep-out recommendations.

---

## Design & Layout Notes

- Place module at PCB edge with antenna area unobstructed.
- Use 10–100Ω series resistors on IO lines for EMI/ESD suppression.
- No reset pin: reset by power cycling the module.
- All IO voltage is 3.3V; use level shifters if connecting to other voltages.
