# HX717 Overview

The HX717 is a dual-channel, high-precision 24-bit analog-to-digital converter (ADC) designed for electronic scales and force measurement applications. It features two selectable differential input channels, each with a low-noise programmable gain amplifier (PGA), making it ideal for interfacing with load cells and other bridge sensors.

Key features include:
- 24-bit resolution with no missing codes
- Two differential input channels (A and B), each with selectable gain
- Integrated voltage regulator to power external sensors
- On-chip clock oscillator (no external crystal required)
- Selectable output data rates (10, 20, 80, or 320 Hz)
- Simple serial interface (PD_SCK and DOUT) for easy MCU integration
- Low power consumption and strong noise immunity

The HX717 is pin- and function-compatible with the popular HX711, but offers additional flexibility and improved performance. It is well-suited for precision weight, force, or pressure measurement in embedded systems.
