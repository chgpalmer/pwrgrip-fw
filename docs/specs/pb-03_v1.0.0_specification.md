## 7. Design Guidance

### 7.1 Module Application Circuit

- Use DC-DC or LDO independent power supply (>=200mA).
- No reset pin: reset by power-off (can use PMOS for power-off reset).
- TX/RX serial lines: reserve 2 resistors in series; 3.3V voltage to prevent serial port affecting reset.

### 7.2 Antenna Layout Requirements

- Place module at edge of motherboard, antenna area out of edge or with empty area along antenna.
- Avoid metal parts and high-frequency devices near antenna.

### 7.3 Power Supply

- Recommended 3.3V, peak current >200mA.
- Prefer LDO; if DC-DC, ripple <30mV.
- Reserve dynamic response capacitance for DC-DC.
- Add ESD devices at 3.3V power interface.

### 7.4 GPIO

- For external IO, use 10-100Ω resistor for EMI/ESD suppression.
- Special IO pull-up/down per spec, affects startup config.
- IO voltage is 3.3V; use level shifter if MCU voltage differs.
- For direct connection to peripherals or terminals, add ESD devices near terminal.
